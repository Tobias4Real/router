# router

Router. The ultimate route finder.

**Hint**: If you want to load large map files, it is highly recommended that you use the release build because the debug build is very slow.

## Buidling
### Release
```sh
  cargo build --release
```

### Debug
```sh
  cargo build
```

## Running (On Linux)
```sh
# For the release build please run:
target/release/router

# For the debug build please run:
target/debug/router
```
